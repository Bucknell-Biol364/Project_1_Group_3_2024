## Target Audience
We are interested in speaking to an audience that is taking this class and has had some rudimentary experience with R. (Have an idea of basic syntax, what a R vector is, etc) The student has likely taken Bio 203/204 in the past but may have forgotten some details and need a refresher.


## Instructions

1. Download the latest version of the R studio.
2. Start by reading the descriptions for each codes and then running the code chunks in the same order they are in.
3. Fill in the empty code chunks and try to be creative.
4. Generate atleast one simple hypothesis from the dataset and try analyzing it using different models or techniques, and statistical functions.

## Objectives
1. To be able to explore data within a dataset based on the data type, including conversion to factors or numerical, and identify outliers or messy data
2. To use filter to create a subset of a variable appropriate to your analysis question
3. To create appropriate and clear graphs to visualize data in both categorical and numeric variables represented in the hypothesis using ggplot2
  the student will be able to create a scatterplot and box and whisker plot
  the student will be able to edit labels and change the style to fit their preferences
  the student will be able to interpret the plot 
4. To use an anova and linear model to help us interpret variables in our provided hypothesis
  the student will be able to create a linear model
  the student will be able to do follow up anova and tukey tests
  the student will be able to interpret the results from these tests



You will need to edit this README.md document when your tutorial is complete to include instructions for using the tutorial.
